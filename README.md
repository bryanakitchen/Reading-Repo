## Prep: Code Challenge 01 - JS Fundamentals

Objects
- Basics: We very briefly touched on shorthand property names. We can say {x} rather than {x: x}.
- Computed Properties: Function calls are most confusing to me so far, but you can define your key and value pair with function calls like you would with shorthand property names.

Classes
- Creation: You can create new classes which can have methods and functions.
- Statics: You can use static in your class before methods and functions.
- Extends: You can extend a class with the word “extends”. 

Destructuring
- Array Destructuring: You can destructure variables like: [a, b] = [1, 2].
- String Destructuring: Similarly, you can destructure strings.
- Object Destructuring: You can destructure objects and arrays, and it makes things a little more complicated.
- Destructuring with Defaults: You can add default values in case no value exists.
- Destructuring Function Parameters: Again, function parameters are a little confusing and I would like lecture on it.
- Destructuring with Alias: This was more code challenges on setting defaults, specifically with function parameters.

Rest
- Rest as a Parameter: Rest can capture all of the parameters or some (but only in the latter portion of the parameters).
- Rest while Destructuring: You can use rest while destructuring your code.

Array Spread: Spread is similar to rest but more powerful in that it can be used multiple times and in any order.

Function Defaults: The simple examples made sense, but the ones that were not simple were lost on me.
